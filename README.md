# 🌱 Growcery — AI-Powered Crop & Produce Analyzer

Growcery uses **AI and computer vision** to analyze images of crops and produce.  
With a single photo, users can instantly learn about **freshness, quality, or possible diseases**, along with **treatment advice** or **storage recommendations** — all accelerated by **AMD ROCm GPUs**.

## 🚀 What It Does

- **For shoppers:** Detects freshness, spoilage, and optimal storage conditions for fruits and vegetables.  
- **For farmers:** Identifies plant diseases and gives actionable treatment or prevention guidance.  
- **For everyone:** Delivers natural, human-readable insights generated by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, powered by the **Google GenAI SDK**.

## 🧩 System Architecture

```
[ Next.js (TypeScript) Frontend ]
        │
        ▼
[ FastAPI Backend (Python + PyTorch on ROCm) ]
        │
        ▼
[ Gemini 2.5 Flash (GenAI API) ]
```

1. **Image Capture / Upload** — Users upload a photo from the web app.  
2. **Inference Stage** — FastAPI sends the image to PyTorch models (MobileNetV3, EfficientNetV2) accelerated by AMD ROCm.  
3. **Reasoning Stage** — The backend calls **Gemini 2.5 Flash** through the **Google GenAI SDK for TypeScript** to interpret raw predictions.  
4. **Response Delivery** — Gemini returns descriptive advice (e.g. *“This tomato shows early blight. Treat with copper fungicide and avoid overhead watering.”*)  
5. **Frontend Display** — Results and latency stats are displayed in the web UI.
