# 🌱 Growcery — AI-Powered Crop & Produce Analyzer

Growcery uses **AI and computer vision** to analyze images of crops and produce.  
With a single photo, users can instantly learn about **freshness, quality, or possible diseases**, along with **treatment advice** or **storage recommendations** — all accelerated by **AMD ROCm GPUs**.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- **For shoppers:** Detects freshness, spoilage, and optimal storage conditions for fruits and vegetables.  
- **For farmers:** Identifies plant diseases and gives actionable treatment or prevention guidance.  
- **For everyone:** Delivers natural, human-readable insights generated by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, powered by the **Google GenAI SDK**.

## 🧩 System Architecture

```
[ Next.js (TypeScript) Frontend ]
        │
        ▼
[ FastAPI Backend (Python + PyTorch on ROCm) ]
        │
        ▼
[ Gemini 2.5 Flash (GenAI API) ]
```

1. **Image Capture / Upload** — Users upload a photo from the web app.  
2. **Inference Stage** — FastAPI sends the image to PyTorch models (MobileNetV3, EfficientNetV2) accelerated by AMD ROCm.  
3. **Reasoning Stage** — The backend calls **Gemini 2.5 Flash** through the **Google GenAI SDK for TypeScript** to interpret raw predictions.  
4. **Response Delivery** — Gemini returns descriptive advice (e.g. *“This tomato shows early blight. Treat with copper fungicide and avoid overhead watering.”*)  
5. **Frontend Display** — Results and latency stats are displayed in the web UI.

## 🧰 Setup

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/growcery.git
cd growcery/backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3️⃣ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both `backend/` and `frontend/`:

#### backend/.env
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_genai_key
ROCM_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

#### frontend/.env
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## 🧬 Example JSON Flow

```json
{
  "image": "base64encodedimage",
  "predictions": {
    "Tomato__Healthy": 0.06,
    "Tomato__Early_Blight": 0.91,
    "Tomato__Late_Blight": 0.03
  },
  "latency_ms": 128,
  "gemini_reasoning": "The plant shows early signs of blight. Remove affected leaves and apply a copper-based fungicide."
}
```

---

## 🧪 Running Locally

```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Start frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
